# Eclipse's Tweakeroo Additions

This mod contains some basic modifications/additions I made to [Tweakeroo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tweakeroo).

## License

This mod is licensed under GNU GPLv3.

## Usage

This mod is currently only available for Minecraft 1.20.1 and Tweakeroo 0.17.1. All added config
entries are integrated into Tweakeroo's config, the mod doesn't have a config itself.

## Developing

Tweakeroo 0.17.1 and the Malilib version it requires are to be downloaded manually and put in the `lib`
directory, named `tweakeroo.jar` and `malilib.jar` respectively.

## Modifications

At the moment, this mod makes the following modifications:

- Added `disableEntityCollisions` yeet, which disables entity collisions. You can still push other entities, but they can't push you.
