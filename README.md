This mod is currently available for Minecraft 1.21+1, Tweakeroo version 0.21.50. Ports for versions 1.19.4, 1.20.1, 1.20.4,
and 1.20.5+6 are available, but are no longer updated. All added config entries are integrated into Tweakeroo's config,
the mod doesn't have a config itself.

## Modifications

At the moment, this mod makes the following modifications:

- Added `handRestockUnstackable` generic option, which toggles whether to restock unstackable items with `tweakHandRestock`.
- Added `commandOnlyAdultPets` generic option, which toggles whether to only select adult pets with `sitDownNearbyPets` and `standUpNearbyPets` hotkeys.
- Added `pistonFlexiblePlacementFix` fix, which fixes inverse rotation placement of pistons, dispensers and droppers with `tweakFlexibleBlockPlacement` (allows placing these blocks facing away from you).
- Added `handRestockCreativeFix` fix, which disables `tweakHandRestock` when the player is in creative mode.
- Added `tweakPlayerList` tweak, which modifies the player (tab) list in various ways, depending on how configured in the `Generic` category:
  - If `playerListHideHeader` is enabled, it hides the additional player list header some servers use.
  - If `playerListHideFooter` is enabled, it hides the additional player list footer some servers use.
  - If `playerListHideObjective` is enabled, it hides the scoreboard objective from the player list.
  - If `playerListNames` is enabled, it uses fancy names for the names that appear in the list.
  - If `playerListBelowBossbar` is enabled, the player list will be moved below all bossbars rendering.
  - `playerListOrder` configures the order in which players appear in the player list.
- Added `tweakPlayerNames` tweak, which enables using fancy names for the names rendered above players.
- Added `tweakMobNames` tweak, which enables using fancy names for the names rendered above mobs, and makes these always render.
- Added `tweakChatMessages` tweak, which tries to turn custom formatted chat messages into vanilla ones. It is a bit buggy at the moment, issues can occur.
- Added `tweakSlippery` tweak, mostly for fun, which overrides the slipperiness of every block, can be configured using the `slipperiness` generic option.
  - Can also be used to disable slipperiness altogether (including for ice blocks and such), by setting to the minimal value.
  - Also affects vehicles (such as horses and boats) you're driving if `slipperinessAffectVehicles` is enabled.
- Added `tweakJumpVelocity` tweak, also mostly for fun, which overrides the jump velocity setting of every block. Can be configured using the `jumpVelocity` generic option.
  - This option is set to `1.15` by default, which is just enough to allow jumping over fences, walls, etc.
- Added `tweakDurabilityCheck` tweak, which displays a message when an item you're using, or a piece of armour you're wearing, is close to breaking.
  - Can also disable using items that are close to breaking by setting the generic option `durabilityCheckPreventUse` to `true`.
    - When to start disabling item usage can be configured using the `durabilityCheckPreventUseThreshold` option.
  - Displays a message whenever an item's durability is 10% of it's maximum durability, with a cooldown that can be configured using the `durabilityWarningCooldown` option.
- Added `tweakStatusEffectHud` tweak, which modifies the way status effect icons are rendered to include duration time.
- Added `tweakAutoReconnect` tweak, which automatically reconnects to a server after being disconnected from it (with a small delay, can be configured using the `autoReconnectTime` generic option).
- Added `tweakPlayerInfoNotifications` tweak, which posts notifications in chat when the client receives a [Player Info Update](https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Player_Info_Update) or a [Player Info Remove](https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Player_Info_Remove) packet. Can be configured in `Generic`:
  - If `playerAddRemoveNotification` is enabled, notifications will be posted in chat when a player info entry is added or removed.
  - If `playerGamemodeNotification` is enabled, notifications will be posted in chat when a player info entry changes gamemode.
  - If `playerListedNotification` is enabled, notifications will be posted in chat when a player info entry is added or removed from the player list.
  - If `playerDisplayNameNotification` is enabled, notifications will be posted in chat when a player info entry changes display name.
- Added `tweakBoats`, which disables the momentum boats gain on turning and allows boats to jump 1 block high. Can be further configured in `Generic`:
  - If `spiderBoat` is enabled, boats can climb walls like spiders. This is a bit buggy, and was mostly added for fun.
  - If `boatPlayerYaw` is enabled, boats follow the crosshair of the player controlling them.
- Added `tweakCreativeElytraFlight`, which allows creative elytra flight in survival while using an elytra.
  - May be considered cheating on some servers, use at your own risk.
- Added `tweakRenderOperatorBlocks`, which makes operator blocks (barrier, light and structure void blocks) have a texture.
- Added `tweakNumberHud`, which replaces parts of the HUD with a number-based design. Can be further configured in `Generic`:
  - `healthWarningThreshold` determines when to start flashing the health value.
  - `hungerWarningThreshold` determines when to start flashing the hunger value.
  - `airWarningThreshold` determines when to start flashing the air value.
  - If `numberHudDurabilityWarning` is enabled, a flashing text is shown when items in your hotbar or armour slots are at low durability.
- Added `tweakLodestoneCompass`, which allows you to see the exact position of a lodestone compass by right-clicking it with the tweak enabled.
- Added `disableEntityCollisions` yeet, which disables entity collisions. You can still push other entities, but they can't push you.
- Added `disableKnockback` yeet, which disables taking knockback.
  - When `disableExplosionKnockback` in `Generic` is set to true, also disables knockback from explosions. 
- Added `disableFogModifiers` yeet, which disables all fog modifiers (water, lava, powdered snow, darkness, etc.).
- Added `disableArmorRestriction` yeet, which disables the restriction of armour slots in the inventory. May not work on servers.
- Added `disableBindingCurse` yeet, which disables Curse of Binding. May not work on servers.
- Added `disableItemCooldown` yeet, which disables the cooldown on ender pearls, goat horns, and more. May not work on servers.
- Added `disableIllegalCharacterCheck` yeet, which allows using special characters as U+00A7 (ยง), U+007F and more in all text boxes. May not work on servers.
- Added `disableWorldBorder` yeet, which disables all world border restrictions.
- Added `disableBedExplosions` yeet, which disables bed explosions in dimensions where beds don't work, by disabling clicking on them.
- Added `disableAllayItemUse` yeet, which disables giving items to allays.
  - When allays are dancing, you can still give them amethyst shards to duplicate them.
- Added `disableOffhandUse` yeet, which disables being able to use items in the offhand.
- Added `disableHorseJumpCharge` yeet, which disables the horse jump charge (pressing space once immediately uses the maximum horse jump height).
- Added `disableOverlayRender` to disable rendering various overlays, such as the vignette, spyglass, carved pumpkin and powdered snow overlays.
- Added `disableAllNamesInF1`, which hides all entity names when the HUD is disabled (vanilla Minecraft still renders the names of entities in teams).

### Fancy names

Fancy names are modifications to names to make them include more information. They can be configured
using the `fancyNameElements` setting in the `Generic` category. Each element can either contain one placeholder, or a string to display.
The following placeholders are available:

- `{name}` - replaces with the (display)name of the mob/player.
- `{rawname}` - replaces with the raw, unformatted name/IGN of the mob/player.
- `{gamemode}` - replaces with the gamemode of the player.
- `{ping}` - replaces with the ping/latency of the player.
- `{health}` - replaces with the amount of HP of the mob/player.
- `{uuid}` - replaces with the UUID of the mob/player.
- `{team}` - replaces with the name of the team the mob/player is in, or is omitted if they aren't in any team.
- `{key}` - replaces with `KEY` or `NO KEY`, depending on whether the player has sent their public key used for signing chat messages to the server.
- `{attack}` - replaces with the current value of the `generic.attack_damage` attribute of the mob/player.
  - Shows critical damage addition (players only) as well by default, but can be disabled using the `attackPlaceholderShowCritical` generic option.
- `{armor}` - replaces with the current value of the `generic.armor` attribute, the `generic.armor_toughness` attribute, and the EPF value of the mob/player.
- `{distance}` - replaces with the distance to the mob/player.
- `{statuseffect}` - replaces with the status effects of a player/entity. Only effects with particles are visible.
- `{horsestats}` - replaces with the speed and jump attributes of a horse entity.
  - Speed is converted to m/s, the jump value is raw.
- `{rawhorsestats}` - replaces with the raw speed and jump attributes of a horse entity.

Certain placeholders, like `{healh}`, `{attack}`, etc., may only work in the player list when the player is in render distance range.
