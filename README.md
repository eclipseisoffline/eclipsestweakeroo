## Usage

Mod builds can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipseisoffline/eclipsestweakeroo/packages/2043865/versions).

This mod is currently available for Minecraft 1.20.1 and 1.20.4, with Tweakeroo versions 0.17.1 and 0.19.1 respectively.
All added config entries are integrated into Tweakeroo's config, the mod doesn't have a config itself.

## Modifications

At the moment, this mod makes the following modifications:

- Added `disableEntityCollisions` yeet, which disables entity collisions. You can still push other entities, but they can't push you.
- Added `disableTabHeader` yeet, which hides the header in the player list.
- Added `disableTabFooter` yeet, which hides the footer in the player list.
- Added `handRestockUnstackable` generic option, which toggles whether to restock unstackable items with `tweakHandRestock`.
